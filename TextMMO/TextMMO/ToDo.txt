Round based gameplay:

Out of combat:
Every step you do means the enemies will also do one step. (Some move more or less than one step depending on their speed stat)
In Multiplayer every player moves 1 step when every player inserted 1 command or set himself to idle. When idle, others dont have to wait for your command.
The idle state stays active until combat or a conversation begins.

In combat:
Every player in the group can queue one skill/attack/command. Once everyone did so the execution round begins.
(The player or monster with the highest speed stat begins, then the order is descending from highest speed to lowest.)
Within the execution round the players will execute their commands one after each other.
Once everyone has finished the next round starts, till no enemies or players remain.
